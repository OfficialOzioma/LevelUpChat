Arctic Media Solutions Code Test   

Thanks for taking the time to work this code test. Each time we hire a new developer we come up with an application similar to what we are hiring
for and ask each potential developer to accomplish a number of tasks. This allows us to see each persons ability and to find out of they can do the 
required work long term. 

Please complete the following tasks. 

Setup Dev (suggested)
1. setup database using SQLITE
2. Upgrade all composer and NPM packages to the latest version
3. composter install and npm install
4. Signup and create your own personal pusher channel credentials

Add ONE following features: (choose 1)
1. Create a presence / user list for all active users in the given chat room
2. Create a Room pop up and allow users to join the room as a new tab.
3. Create a guest login system that allows someone to type a username and join chat without creating an account

Fix the following errors (total time 1-2 hours)
1. New messages do not show up without page reload. Messages should be real time for all users
2. User image should match user name (currently it shows all images beside a user as the logged in user
3. Show time as "time ago) eg: 1 minute ago, 11 hours ago. Anything under 1 minute should say "just now"

Once you are completed, create a PR and I or Jack will review your code. Please send all questions to ryan@arcticmedia.io and I will respond within 24 hours.
